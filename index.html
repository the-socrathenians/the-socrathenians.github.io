          <p>
            In a university split across multiple campuses, especially if those campuses are in different cities across different countries, 
            connection between people is often harder than it needs to be.
            This holds especially true for cases wherein one campus is much smaller and newer and where connection will likely be difficult both within 
            the new campus as well as across either campus.
            The commute is no less difficult, a part of daily life dreaded by many and frequently neither productive nor relaxing.
          </p>
          <p>
            We aim to address two problems: the difficulty in digital intra- and interconnectivity as it pertains to ECH, as well as making the physical 
            commute between ETH in Zurich and ECH in Heilbronn both pleasant and even fun.
            So far no ideal solution exists that addresses either problem. Our match-making product is an elegant, sleek, and lightweight solution to both 
            problems at once, with a potentially much broader application.

        <h2 class="title is-3"> The Challenge</h2>
        <div class="content has-text-justified">
          <p>
            The two main challenges are as follows: the difficulty in both digital intra- and interconnectivity as it pertains to ECH, as well as a 
            cumbersome physical commute between ETH in Zurich and 
            ECH in Heilbronn. So far no ideal solution exists that addresses either problem, let alone one that addresses both issues in tandem.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="title is-3">Design Process</h2>
        <div class="content has-text-justified">
          <p>
            Our initial direction was to create a product that would address the challenges of connectivity and commuting between ETH and ECH.
            We addressed this originally through a seating chart generator for the bus, as well as an ergonomic transportation environment.
            However, we quickly realized that none of the members of the team had experience in mechanical engineering or ergonmic design, 
            and thus we pivoted to a software solution.
            We brainstormed to understand the needs and pain points of students, which informed our design decisions for a match-making application.
            The design process involved brainstorming sessions, sketching, and prototyping to create a user-friendly 
            interface that would facilitate easy matching and communication.
            Overall, we are proud of the seamless matching experience we have created, which we believe will greatly 
            enhance the connectivity and commuting experience for students at ECH.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="title is-3">The Design</h2>
        <div class="content has-text-justified">  
          <p>
            This app has applications within the commute, aiming to connect (with best effort) two or more people for a lively discussion, 
            be it for expanding research possibilities, exchanging valuable knowledge and skills across students, or simply a friendly 
            conversation to strengthen the bonds within and across the campuses.
            The app's design however is very general purpose, allowing for it to be used in a wider variety of situations, 
            such as during breaks in a new lecture or a dining hall which, despite being full, may feel hard to connect with others.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="title is-3">The Demo</h2>
        <div class="content has-text-justified">
          <p>
            The key feature we chose to implement for the live demo is the matching algorithm, which matches people across overall similarity on the bulk of 
            topics which interest them.
            We use artificial intelligence to analyze the text of the user-provided topics, and then match people based on the similarity of their topics.
            The algorithm is designed to be flexible, allowing for a wide variety of topics to be matched, and not just the most ideal ones, 
            giving an overall score to each match.
            The reasoning for this specific approach was that merely limiting the matching to one or two ideal topic matches will also gravely limit 
            the possible conversation topics as well as how heuristically likely it is for any two people to get along - this way,
            we maximize the probability of a conversation not only taking place, but being a pleasant and profitable 
            experience for social learning in an academic setting.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="title is-3">Technical Details</h2>
        <div class="content has-text-justified">
          <p>
            The app is built using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end, and a tensorflow model for the backend.
            The matching algorithm is implemented using a tensorflow sentence encoder (v1.3.3) to analyze user-provided topics and calculate similarity scores.
            The app is designed to be very lightweight and responsive, ensuring a smooth user experience across different devices.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="title is-3">Looking Beyond</h2>
        <div class="content has-text-justified">
          <p>
            Over the next years, and with sufficient funding, this project could be expanded to include more campuses, more cities, and even more countries.
            Certainly, the app could be expanded to include more features, such as a calendar integration to allow for scheduling meetings, 
            or a chat feature to allow for communication between matched users.
            In the future, we could use new technologies that do not yet exist, such as ultra-powerful AGI, to develop more powerful matching algorithms 
            to assist in meaningful human connection.
